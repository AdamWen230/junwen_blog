## August 6, 2024

In the summer of 2021, I stayed on campus to prepare for studying abroad and various competition projects. After spending the entire day immersed in the library or lab, it would be nearly 10 p.m. by the time I returned to my dorm. Around that hour, I often went to the burger joint next to the campus canteen to grab a combo: a small burger, a serving of fries, and a cup of coke, all for about 14 yuan. Back in my dorm, I would invariably open up food channels on BiliBili or YouTube, carefully selecting a video to enjoy with my meal. This ritual made a modest burger combo of just over ten yuan taste so much better.

One video series that left a deep impression on me was 觅食MeetFood's Gourmet Journey Around United States. I thought to myself that if I ever had the chance to study in the U.S., I must try out these restaurants.

Today in 2024, I was fortunate enough to travel to Vegas on a business trip. After wrapping up my work and some other tasks, it was already 10 p.m., so I headed downstairs in search of food. By chance, I discovered that a Gordon Ramsay Burger was open right in the casino beneath my hotel—the very one I'd seen in videos three years ago. I've watched Gordon Ramsay's review videos no less than ten times—the most famous being Hell's Kitchen—but I remembered that his burger place was also quite good, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered a truffle burger, truffle fries, and a cola. The meal perfectly matched the image I had in my mind.

When the bill came, including tip, it totaled $60—dozens of times more than the small burgers I used to eat three years ago. The truffle burger featured on the food channels was indeed far superior to those earlier burgers, but I couldn't help missing the 14-yuan combo. I remember clearly how delicious that small burger was, yet the specific taste has grown fuzzy in my memory.

After eating, I took a stroll along the Las Vegas Stripe. A diverse crowd, dazzling neon lights, and a mix of various scents and sounds intertwined—the night here was just beginning.

The 40-degree Celsius night in Las Vegas seemed somewhat similar to those in Nanjing. I felt a longing to ride an electric scooter like I used to, taking a leisurely ride. But I realized I no longer had the scooter from three years ago, nor could I, as before, ride through the muggy downpours, splashing water along the way, racing through the summer nights on campus.

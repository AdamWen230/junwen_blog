## About Me üòé

Hello my friend, welcome to my blog, this is Jun! 

I am currently a master's student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology (Cyberspace Security) from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/).

I am interested in information security, exploring both offensive and defensive strategies, with a focus on application security, threat detection and response, and vulnerability analysis.

Outside of that, I love traveling and sports, especially in swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (10+ years), basketball üèÄ (10+ years), and soccer ‚öΩ (watching matches a lot, but not much of a player myself). I really admire players who possess self-discipline and strong mentality, as they often inspire me when I encounter obstacles in my life. Cristiano Ronaldo and Kobe Bryant are two of the players I really look up to.

> I want to use my blog to share what I learn about security, from the cool stuff I discover to just everyday life. I hope it can be a mix of useful tech info and just sharing stories from my life üî•
